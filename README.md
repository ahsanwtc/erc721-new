# Super Mario World NFT Project

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/64c50945-f93b-4c62-81ef-46fdace12c39/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/super-mario-world-collection/deploys)

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.
